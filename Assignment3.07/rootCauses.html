          <h3>Root Cause #1:</h3>
          <p>Low-income families often can't afford healthcare at all, whether it be through health insurance or external factors</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h5>Evidence 1:</h5>
          <p>"More than 90% of the uninsured cite cost as the main barrier to getting care"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h5>Explanation:</h5>
          <p>When cost is a main deterrent for obtaining health insurance, it's clear that low-income families are hurt the most</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h5>Evidence 2:</h5>
          <p>"Almost 40% of adults uninsured for a year or more, did not see a physician when needed in the past year because of cost"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h5>Explanation:</h5>
          <p>Because most uninsured people are low-income, this statistic shows that these people aren't receiving the attention they need without healthcare as well</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col">
          <h3>Root Cause #2:</h3>
          <p>Living in poverty has adverse effects, which can worsen one's health and cause a greater need for medical attention</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h5>Evidence 1:</h5>
          <p>"Americans living in families that earn less than $35,000 a year are four times as likely to report being nervous and five times as likely to report being sad all or most of the time, compared to those living in families earning more than $100,000 a year"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h5>Explanation:</h5>
          <p>Poverty has an emotional effect on people as well, which is linked to a more vulnerable state of physical health</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h5>Evidence 2:</h5>
          <p>"People in families that earn less than $35,000 a year are three times more likely to smoke as those in families with an annual income of more than $100,000"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h5>Explanation:</h5>
          <p>People in low-income families often result in the development of bad habits, causing worsening physical health and a greater need for medical attention</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Implications</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center">Making healthcare more affordable must be a key focus. Healthcare - both through health insurance and external factors - is too expensive for low-income families. Bad habits and adverse effects that directly stem from poverty only add on to their deteriorating physical health because  of this inaccessibility to healthcare. To combat this issue, we must look both at financial accessibility and investigating how poverty affects our physical health.</p>
